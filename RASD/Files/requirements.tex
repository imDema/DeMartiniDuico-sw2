\subsection{External interface Requirements}

\emph{CLup} is a web application which can be accessed from web browsers.

\subsubsection{User interfaces}
\subsubsection{Hardware interfaces}
The \emph{CLup} client shall be available for devices capable of rendering a web page with javascript and internet access, this includes smartphones, tablets and personal computers.

Although not strictly required, the devices used by the staff should have a camera to scan QR codes

\subsubsection{Software interfaces}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Web browser}: the applicative requires a web browser capable of rendering HTML5 web pages with Javascript
    \item \textbf{Maps service}: although not required for the core functionality, having access to a maps service on the device will improve user experience
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Communication interfaces}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{User}: requires a internet connection in order to get a token. Access to the store can be done offline if necessary.
    \item \emph{Staff}: requires a internet connection in order to communicate with the server and validate tokens or emit substitute tickets.
\end{itemize}
The system shall use the HTTPS protocol to provide secure communication from the client to the server.
\subsection{Functional requirements}

\subsection{Performance Requirements}
\begin{itemize} 
\item Validating a token must be done as soon as possible and in no more than 5 seconds from when the token was acquired by the staff. This is required to achieve sufficient throughput and prevent queues from forming at the entrance.
\item When obtaining a token the user shall receive a response from the server within 15 seconds, since in this case time is not critical.
\item Tokens shall be added to the system as soon as possible within 30 seconds.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Design constraints}
\subsubsection{Standards compliance}
The device where the \emph{CLup} application is installed must run an HTML5 compatible browser, with Javascript ES6 (or above) support.
Data will be exchanged using the HTTP protocol.
\subsubsection{Hardware limitations}
Running the app requires a smartphone that supports one of the modern web browser engines; older cellphones whose official support has been discontinued shall not be supported.
To allow the validation of tickets by the Third Party Staff, the device should also be equipped with a camera of any resolution above 8 Megapixel.
%\subsubsection{Other constraints}

\subsection{Software System Attributes}
\subsubsection{Reliability}
\textit{CLup} should be available 24/7 in order to allow Users to generate Bookings at any time of the day. However, in the night, it can be accepted to have periods of up to 2 hours during which the service is unavailable because of maintenance.
\subsubsection{Availability}
\emph{CLup} does not have a critical nature, but any downtime could cause serious problems to the management of the entrances to Shops. Hence, 99\% of availability during daytime is required for \emph{CLup} to be effective. At night time, the availability requirement can be relaxed, as long as it is not lower than 90\%, considering that Bookings should be possible at any hour.
\subsubsection{Security}
All connections must use HTTP over TLS (HTTPS), with a TLS version above 1.2, to guarantee a secure layer of communication.
This is necessary to guarantee the authentication of the \emph{CLup} servers, the confidentiality and integrity of the information sent each way.
Protocols and encryption algorithms will be discussed in detail in the Design Document.
\subsubsection{Maintainability}
The service must be implemented in a high-level language that allows unit testing and is open to corrections. In case of bugs, it should be possible to fix and update the running instance of the service within 1-2 days.
The backend system must allow to run private instances on a testnet, to attest the proper functioning before deployment.
The Application will be updated automatically by reloading the webpage, avoiding old versions of the frontend software to circulate.
\subsubsection{Portability}
\textit{Clup} should have the topmost grade of portability. It should be accessible via any device connected to the Internet, with support for a modern browser, since it will be built as a Web Application.
%The backend, as well, should be easily moved to a different server: it must be clearly subdivided in independent units that can be .
