\subsection{External interface Requirements}

\emph{CLup} is a web application which can be accessed from web browsers.

\subsubsection{User interfaces}
\subsubsection{Hardware interfaces}
The \emph{CLup} client shall be available for devices capable of rendering a web page with javascript and internet access, this includes smartphones, tablets and personal computers.

Although not strictly required, the devices used by the staff should have a camera to scan QR codes

\subsubsection{Software interfaces}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Web browser}: the applicative requires a web browser capable of rendering HTML5 web pages with Javascript
    \item \textbf{Maps service}: although not required for the core functionality, having access to a maps service on the device will improve user experience
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Communication interfaces}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{User}: requires a internet connection in order to get a token. Access to the store can be done offline if necessary.
    \item \emph{Staff}: requires a internet connection in order to communicate with the server and validate tokens or emit substitute tickets.
\end{itemize}
The system shall use the HTTPS protocol to provide secure communication from the client to the server.
\subsection{Functional requirements}

\subsection{Performance Requirements}
\begin{itemize} 
\item Validating a token must be done as soon as possible and in no more than 5 seconds from when the token was acquired by the staff. This is required to achieve sufficient throughput and prevent queues from forming at the entrance.
\item When obtaining a token the user shall receive a response from the server within 15 seconds, since in this case time is not critical.
\item Tokens shall be added to the system as soon as possible within 30 seconds.
\end{itemize}
